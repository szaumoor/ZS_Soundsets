# ZS_Soundsets

## Introduction

This mods adds female soundsets for BG, BG2, BGEE, BG2EE, BGT, and EET for player use. Do not ask about male soundsets or AI. I will only add soundsets made by voice artists. So far there are only two, both made by Glyph.

While this mod should be installable in the original games, and IWD2, I have no means of confirming whether it works. Please offer feedback if you do try it.

## Components

### Pious Knight (0)

This is a soundset for the "pious knight", which is a soundset for a paladin-esque class or pious good character.

A peculiarity in this case is that she has two voice lines that refer to her deity. I wanted to give the user the chance of deciding what that deity is, or at least, what the gender manifestation often is for that deity, so in the configuration file you may choose to set this as "M" (God) or "F" (Goddess). Just a tiny detail for roleplaying purposes. Note that this is decided at installation time, there's no option after installation of changing between both versions.

### Deadly rogue (1)

This is a soundset for the "deadly rogue", which is a soundset for a ruthless rogue type (assassin, shadowdancer...), though not outright evil, with a somewhat playful and cynical tone.
